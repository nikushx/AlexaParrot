# AlexaParrot
A "Parrot" skill I developed for the Amazon Alexa/Echo that repeats anything you say to it.

It will be available to the public if it is accepeted into the Alexa Skill store, but in the meantime you can use it by importing this code into your own Amazon developer console.

I will update if it is accepted.
